I recently finished _Leonardo da Vinci_ by Walter Isaacson, and it turned out to be much more than just an informative biography. It felt like I was walking alongside the author, rediscovering and investigating the life of this Renaissance master.

### Key Takeaways

- **Centuries Ahead of His Time:** Leonardo wasn’t just a brilliant painter—he was a visionary. His ideas, from anatomy to engineering, were often too advanced for his contemporaries to grasp.
- **The Perfectionist's Dilemma:** Leonardo’s obsession with perfection led to many unfinished works and studies. His pursuit of excellence sometimes stopped him from completing projects, leaving behind sketches and ideas that were never fully realized.
- **Challenger of the Status Quo:** He questioned everything. Leonardo didn’t just accept what books or masters taught him—he put knowledge to the test. He pushed boundaries, refusing to settle for conventional wisdom.

- **Learning by Doing:** Leonardo prioritized empirical learning over theoretical knowledge. While this made him a brilliant observer and experimenter, there were moments where his lack of theory put him at a disadvantage. Nevertheless, his hands-on approach drove much of his groundbreaking work.
- **The Quintessential Renaissance Man:** He was a perfect example of a polymath, constantly jumping between disciplines. Whether it was painting, anatomy, or engineering, Leonardo applied what he learned in one field to another. For instance, his detailed dissections of human bodies greatly influenced the lifelike movement and precision in his artwork.

### Lessons to Apply

Reading about Leonardo made me reflect on a few things that we can carry into our life and work:

- **Finish What You Start:** Unlike Leonardo, it’s crucial to bring projects to completion. Perfection is great, but sometimes, finishing and moving forward is better.

- **Balance Empirical Learning with Theory:** While learning by doing is valuable, a bit of theory can go a long way in providing context and depth.

- **Allow for Distractions (Productive Ones):** It’s okay to get a little distracted at times if it means coming back to a project with fresh ideas and energy.

- **Cultivate Insatiable Curiosity:** Like Leonardo, having a deep curiosity about everything around you can lead to incredible discoveries. Never stop asking questions.

- **Be a Keen Observer:** One of Leonardo’s greatest strengths was his attention to detail. Taking the time to observe the world carefully can lead to insights others might miss.

Isaacson’s biography serves as a reminder that being curious, multidisciplinary, and a little bit obsessive can lead to remarkable achievements. But it also highlights the importance of balancing passion with practicality—sometimes, finishing things is just as important as starting them.
