I like to write straightforward, practical posts about the things I learn and experience.

## Topics

I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:

- Web development
- ML/AI
- Books I'm reading
- Personal projects
- News (mostly tech and economics related)
- Thoughts and reflections

## Frequency

There's no set schedule; the posts will come when they come.
